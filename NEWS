Version 0.5.0

* Add a source gsia.c to handle the hypergeometric tests.
  Split the jobs among several static functions.

* Keep the main.c to handle the command-line arguments.

* The user can compare her files case sensitive or
  insensitive.

* The user can save the comparation among list, feature and
  universe files.

* --feature-file can be passed more than once, this way,
  it's possible to test list against several features.

* All the results are delivered in a multipart TSV file
  style, with headers beggining with # and tables separated
  by blank lines.

Version 0.4.0

* Replace GMP with GSL (Gnu Scientific Library) in order
  to make hypergeometric tests. There is a big gain in
  speed.

* Change the 'comm' interface. Now there is no need to
  create Comm objects and after that compare_arrays ().
  compare_arrays () retuns an initialized Comm object.

Version 0.3.0

* Add .travis.yml in order to enable cloud testing inside a
  vanilla environment. Include a travis CI badge into the
  README.md.

* Make hypergeometric testing workable. Now, the user can
  pass 3 files (the universe list, the success state list
  and the testing list) and gsia will automatically calculate
  all the required parameters to make the test (N, K, n, k).

* Fix a bug in the phyper function that causes assertion
  error.

Version 0.2.0

* Implement error handling mechanism with domains and error code
  in order to avoid rewriting sys error code.

* Add an array (PtrArray) interface based on GArray.

* Add IO interface to read a whole file line into a PtrArray. Also,
  implement a unix-like 'comm' function to compare file lines.

Version 0.1.0

* Initial version. Project was set to work with 'autotools' and
  testing with the framework 'check'.

* For now, it is only possible to run a hypergeometric test.
