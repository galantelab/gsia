Version 0.2.0

* Implement error handling mechanism with domains and error code
  in order to avoid rewriting sys error code.

* Add an array (PtrArray) interface based on GArray.

* Add IO interface to read a whole file line into a PtrArray. Also,
  implement a unix-like 'comm' function to compare file lines.

Version 0.1.0

* Initial version. Project was set to work with 'autotools' and
  testing with the framework 'check'.

* For now, it is only possible to run a hypergeometric test.
